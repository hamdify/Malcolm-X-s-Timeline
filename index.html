        <p>Malcolm X, born Malcolm Little on May 19, 1925, was a prominent civil rights activist, speaker, and advocate
            for Black empowerment.
            His life journey took him from a troubled childhood marked by racial discrimination and personal loss to
            becoming one of the most influential figures in the struggle for racial equality.
            Malcolm’s intellectual growth, transformation during his time in prison, and his leadership within the
            Nation of Islam propelled him to national prominence. Throughout his life, he championed self-determination,
            racial pride, and the fight against systemic racism.
            Malcolm X’s powerful speeches, unwavering commitment to justice, and evolving ideologies continue to inspire
            and influence people around the world.</p>

        <div id="1925"><span class="semi-bold">1925: Malcolm X is born in Omaha, Nebraska</span>
            <p>Malcolm X is born as Malcolm Little in Omaha, Nebraska. Malcolm Little was born to Earl Little and Louise
                Norton Little. He was the fourth of seven children.</p>
            <p>His father, Earl Little, was an outspoken Baptist preacher and a follower of Marcus Garvey’s Universal
                Negro Improvement Association.</p>
            <p>Malcolm’s family faced racial discrimination, and his father’s activism made them targets of violence
                from white supremacist groups.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="1931"><span class="semi-bold">1931: Family moves to Lansing, Michigan</span>
            <p>When Malcolm was around six years old, his family moved to Lansing, Michigan, seeking to escape the
                increasing threats and violence they faced in Omaha. However, racial tensions and discrimination were
                still prevalent in their new community.</p>

                family when Malcolm was just 14 years old. His father, Earl Little, was found dead on the tracks of a
                streetcar line.</p>

            <p>The official cause of death was listed as a streetcar accident, but there were strong indications that
                his father’s death was a targeted act of violence due to his activism.</p>
            <p>This event deeply impacted Malcolm and had a profound effect on his worldview, fueling his determination
                to fight against racial injustice and oppression.</p>

        <div id="1941"><span class="semi-bold">1941: Mother is committed to a mental institution</span>
            <p>Malcolm’s mother, Louise Little, is committed to a mental institution. Following the death of his father,
                Malcolm and his siblings faced further hardship when their mother, Louise Little, experienced a mental
                breakdown.</p>
            <p> She was subsequently committed to a state mental institution. As a result, Malcolm and his siblings were
                separated and placed in various foster homes and orphanages. This disruption in his family life had a
                profound impact on Malcolm’s upbringing and sense of identity.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="1946"><span class="semi-bold">1946: Malcolm is paroled from prison</span>
            <p>Malcolm’s troubled adolescence led him down a path of criminal activities, and at the age of 20, he was
                arrested and sentenced to prison for burglary charges. During his time behind bars, Malcolm began a
                transformative journey of education and self-reflection.</p>
            <p>He delved into books, particularly works by Elijah Muhammad and the teachings of the Nation of Islam.

                nationalist religious movement led by Elijah Muhammad.</p>
            <p>Influenced by the teachings of Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm underwent a profound spiritual and ideological
                transformation. He embraced the principles of the Nation of Islam, including black pride, self-reliance,
                and separation from white society.</p>
            <p>After his release from prison, Malcolm X became a devoted member and spokesperson for the Nation of
                Islam.</p>

        <div id="1959"><span class="semi-bold">1959: Makes pilgrimage to Mecca</span>
            <p>Malcolm X makes his first pilgrimage to Mecca, which significantly influences his views on race and
                religion. In 1959, Malcolm X embarked on a life-changing journey to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, to perform the
                Hajj, the Islamic pilgrimage.</p>
            <p>During this pilgrimage, Malcolm had a profound spiritual and intellectual awakening. He was struck by the
                diversity and unity among Muslims of different races and nationalities, which challenged his previous
                views on race and white people.</p>
            <p>Malcolm’s experience in Mecca led him to reevaluate his beliefs about racial separation and fueled his
                commitment to a more inclusive and universal understanding of Islam. This transformation marked a
                significant shift in his ideology and his approach to civil rights activism.</p>

                the early 1960s, Malcolm X had emerged as a prominent national spokesperson for the Nation of Islam.</p>
            <p>His dynamic speaking style, unwavering commitment to Black empowerment, and sharp critique of racial
                injustice attracted significant media attention.</p>
            <p>Malcolm’s eloquence and unapologetic advocacy for self-defense and the rights of African Americans made
                him a powerful voice in the civil rights movement.</p>
            <p>He appeared on various television and radio programs, participated in debates, and delivered influential

        <div id="1964"><span class="semi-bold">1964: Splits from the Nation of Islam, founds Muslim Mosque, Inc. and the
                Organization of Afro-American Unity</span>
            <p>Malcolm X publicly splits from the Nation of Islam due to ideological differences with its leader, Elijah
                Muhammad. In March 1964, tensions between Malcolm X and the leadership of the Nation of Islam,
                particularly its leader Elijah Muhammad, reached a breaking point.</p>
            <p>Malcolm became disillusioned with Elijah Muhammad’s personal conduct, including allegations of
                extramarital affairs and financial improprieties. Additionally, he grew frustrated with the Nation of
                Islam’s separatist stance and its refusal to collaborate with other civil rights organizations.</p>
            <p>As a result, Malcolm publicly announced his split from the Nation of Islam, which caused controversy
                within the movement and marked a significant turning point in his life and activism.</p>
            <p>Malcolm founds the Muslim Mosque, Inc. and the Organization of Afro-American Unity. Following his
                departure from the Nation of Islam, Malcolm X established two new organizations to further his vision of
                Black empowerment and unity.</p>
            <p>He founded the Muslim Mosque, Inc., which aimed to provide spiritual guidance and community services to
                African Americans. Additionally, he formed the Organization of Afro-American Unity, a secular
                organization focused on political and social activism.</p>
            <p>Through these organizations, Malcolm sought to promote self-determination, fight against racial
                discrimination, and foster solidarity among African Americans and other marginalized groups.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="1965"><span class="semi-bold">1965: Assassinated on February 21 in New York City</span>

            <p>In a tragic turn of events, Malcolm X was assassinated on February 21, 1965, in New York City. During a
                speaking engagement at the Audubon Ballroom in Manhattan, three members of the Nation of Islam rushed
                the stage and fired multiple shots at Malcolm X.</p>
            <p>He was struck by multiple bullets and succumbed to his injuries shortly after at the age of 39. The
                assassination of Malcolm X shocked the nation and reverberated throughout the civil rights movement.
            <p>His untimely death robbed the world of a charismatic leader and a powerful advocate for justice and
                equality. However, his legacy and ideas continue to inspire generations of activists fighting against
                racial injustice.
